This week we are going to try to extract antibiotics from beatifull flowers from the flowershop. I took a Gerbera and took some colored leaves from the flower and a piece of the stem.
7 grams of each were put in two different bottles and 50 ml ethanol was added. Whait for 2 hours. After 2 hours I seperate the liquid from the leaves/stem. This liquid was boiled down on a heater till some drops remain behind in the bottle. Then I made some filters with a hole puncher fom a coffee filter. Some drops were added on the filter and those filter were placed on the bacterial plates we make last week. Now we waith till next week to see what happened with de bacteria on the plate.
