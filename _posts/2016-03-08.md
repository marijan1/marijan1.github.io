Today we are going to do a ecotoxicological experiment wih Daphnia. 

We put 5 daphnia's in a bottle filled with medium they like and we put different concentrations of ETOH(96%) in it and then wait for 24/48hto see by witch temperature they are going to die. (sorry for that!)
The concentration were:
blanco: no ETOH
0,38 ml ETOH in 30 ml medium
0,19 ml ETOH in 30 ml medium
0,095 ml ETOH in 30 ml medium
0,063 ml ETOH in 30 ml medium
