## project microbiology meets art

First I want to thank you for reading my blog. I follow the biohack academy at the Waag society. In this course I will work on my own project and in this blog I will document this.
So please feel free to read it.

I am an technichian that worked for a long time on a water research institute on a microbiology laboratory. So I have some knowledge about bacteria and how to work with them.
My knowledge about art and design is not so big so my idea is to meet both worlds: microbiology meets art.

I choose a painting from a famous dutch painter called Johannes Vermeer.

The challenge for me is to convert the drawing into lines en put them in the computer. I used natrual tracing paper to get the lines that I want on paper.

I load the drawing in Inkscape and trace the lines. Then save as a dxf file.
The first prototype was in MDF and looks very good!
Then I tryed transparent Acrylic. I test the material because it was thick (5mm). I used the setting: Speed 5, power 100, corner 30. The resukt was good. Now I want to scale the size up. I have a bigger petridish (size 145 x 20). 
This time the laser speed was to low. There was some burned places in the acryl. The machine has to be cleaned.
So next week I will try it again. 

Next thing to try is to see how fast the bacteria will grow on the ager and wich collors they are!
