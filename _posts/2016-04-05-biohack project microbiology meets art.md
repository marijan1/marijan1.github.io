## project microbiology meets art

First I want to thank you for reading my blog. I follow the biohack academy at the Waag society. In this course I will work on my own project and in this blog I will document this.
So please feel free to read it.

I am an technichian that worked for a long time on a water research institute on a microbiology laboratory. So I have some knowledge about bacteria and how to work with them.
My knowledge about art and design is not so big so my idea is to meet both worlds: microbiology meets art.

I choose a painting from a famous dutch painter called Johannes Vermeer.
